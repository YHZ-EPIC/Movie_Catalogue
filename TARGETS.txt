// Added Navbar
// Added Add to WatchList (Only Console.log level) => YET TO TEST IF ACTUALLY IT WORKS
// IF IT ACTUALLY STORES THE DATA OF MOVIES I CLICK FOR WATCH LATER XD

// Somehow gotta deliver this data to WatchList Component,
// But it could only be called by NavBar and Data is within Home Component
